Ever wondered how your mic doesnâ€™t pick up the sound from your speaker during calls, but only your voice even though they are so close physically?

## Real-Time Voice Changer

This Python script enables real-time audio processing to apply various voice effects, such as Robot, Alien, Chipmunk, Giant, and Echo, while capturing input from a microphone and playing the modified audio through the speakers. It also saves the processed audio to a WAV file when the program stops.

### Features
- **Robot Effect**: Modulates the input audio to create a robotic sound.
- **Alien Effect**: Shifts the pitch of the audio to create an alien-like effect.
- **Chipmunk Effect**: Increases the speed and pitch for a chipmunk-style voice.
- **Giant Effect**: Slows down the audio for a deep, giant-like effect.
- **Echo Effect**: Adds an echo to the audio.
- **Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC)**: Reduces echo caused by feedback from speakers to the microphone, enhancing audio clarity and usability in real-time applications.
- Real-time audio processing.
- Saves the processed audio as a WAV file after the program is terminated.
